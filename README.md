ABSTRACT

The MravalJam project explores the potential of gamified music education to address the
challenges of engaging school students in learning more about music. The platform is built
using the Unity Game Development Environment and introduces students to foundational
musical concepts through an interactive sticker-based system. Each sticker represents a
sound layer, allowing students to create melodies while learning about the interplay of
musical elements. To foster cultural appreciation, the platform features themed levels
highlighting diverse musical traditions. These themes are designed to expose students to
global musical diversity while emphasizing creativity and engagement. The application
integrates gamification principles, including progress tracking and immediate feedback,
to enhance motivation and learning outcomes. By transforming music education into an
accessible and enjoyable experience, MravalJam aims to bridge the gap between traditional
music curricula and the interests of modern students, leveraging technology to create a
more dynamic and inclusive educational environment.
